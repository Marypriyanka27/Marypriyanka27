E-Commerce
 
Here We create a Simple E-com app using javascript

Getting the values from the user and display it .The Values contain Product Name,Product Price and Description.

After getting the values CRUD operations performed..Such as Create,Read,Update and Delete.

This is what my question like:

### ECommerce Product CRUD

ECommerce is simple front end app to create/edit/delete/view products.

### Requirements:

This app should list all the products in the first page. Each product will have three
fields - name, price and description.

### Create

There must be "Add new product" in the top. On clicking the button, it should bring to new page (it is a route). In the "Create new product" page, we can give the name(input), price (input) and description(text area) for the product. Finally we have to click "Save" to save the product.

Then on returning to home page, we should see the newly created product in the products list.

In the list, each product will have two buttons - "Edit" and "Delete"

### Edit

If I click the edit button, it will allow me to edit same exact product.
I will update title or description or both, the click "Save". It will save the respective product.

### Delete

If I click the delete button, it will delete the product and remove it from the UI.

### Data Storage

You can store the data in the local storage.
